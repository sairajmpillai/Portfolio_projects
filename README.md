# Portfolio_projects

This repository contains my portfolio projects for the role of Data Analyst or similar roles. This repository contains three projects:

1. Maven Market Analysis project: This was done as part of my Power BI certification course project.
2. Telangana Government Tourism Data Analysis project: This is a portfolio challenge project by a website named Codebasics.io. The dataset was downloaded from the website and the project was completed successfully.
3. SQL Portfolio project: This is an SQL Portfolio project using PostgreSQL. Here I have used the Olympics history dataset from 1896 to 2016. This contains problem statements along with solution SQL queries. The concepts which I have used to answer the queries include aggregations, filtering, joins, CTEs, window functions etc.
